- Lambda's Plotly Dash guide [[link]](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2/portfolio-project/ds6#plotly-dash)


## Portfolio Projects
- [ ] Text-based
  - Instagram NLP too??
- [ ] Image project
  - [ ] Create own Instagram dataset for deep learning. Example: https://github.com/rememberlenny/streetart-notstreetart, tutorial https://blog.floydhub.com/instagram-street-art/
- [ ] Time series analysis. Use: https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2018/03/22/time-series-for-scikit-learn-people-part2/
- [ ] A/B testing/hypothesis testing
- [ ] Visualization
  - [ ] MoMA
- [ ] Geo-mapping
  - [ ] Build week: deforestation
- [ ] Really intense data cleaning (multiple datasets, missing data that requires imputation)
  - [ ] potentially, MoMA
- [ ] Regression analysis (comparing multiple methods)
- [ ] Something that uses SQL
- [ ] Full stack deployment
  - [ ] Build week: deforestation

Each project should have:
- [ ] reproducible & follow best practices (PublicArt has a great readme)
- [ ] put functions in separate file and import them, split data cleaning and data analysis/modelling
- [ ] Use a style guide (PEP8)
- [ ] Executive summary in the Readme or notebook: get to the point! What did you, why did you do it and why is it important? If you use a particularly unusual technique, can you explain it and show that it preforms better than some baseline (e.g. regression).

Great examples (and custom datasets):

## Modeling
>A statistical model is a mathematical model which is modified or trained by the input of data points. Statistical models are often but not always probabilistic. Where the distinction is important we will be careful not to just say "statistical" but to use the following component terms:
A mathematical model specifies a relation among variables, either in functional form that maps inputs to outputs (e.g. y = m x + b) or in relation form (e.g. the following (x, y) pairs are part of the relation).
A probabilistic model specifies a probability distribution over possible values of random variables, e.g., P(x, y), rather than a strict deterministic relationship, e.g., y = f(x).
A trained model uses some training/learning algorithm to take as input a collection of possible models and a collection of data points (e.g. (x, y) pairs) and select the best model. Often this is in the form of choosing the values of parameters (such as m and b above) through a process of statistical inference.

    - 2) The focus on out-of-sample prediction, the relevance of understanding the bias vs. variance tradeoff when reducing prediction error, and the importance of model averaging / testing.
    - 3) The distinction between causal estimates (e.g. the return on schooling) and prediction
    - I guess number 4 (which is part b of #2): the importance of feature reduction when doing prediction, which then leads to a vast number of new tools and techniques.
    - takeaway: you need ID strateg if you have a causal inference question, while prediction questions do not rely on such strateg. [[link]](https://twitter.com/sebcos/status/1217271033213997056)

> Roughly, a topic is a collection of words representative of a particular textual grouping. The words like gun and murder are perhaps more often found in detective fiction rather than erotica, for example. So remember this: topics are bags of words. Crucially, unsupervised1 topic modelling involves logic for the discovery of arbitrary word groupings. We are asking a machine to organize a pile of texts into stacks by “the difference that makes the largest difference.” From the many ways of grouping or classifying a collection of texts, we want those groups that are most starkly different from each other. Often these machine-generated “topics” track human-derived, social categories such as authors or genres. And sometimes these “topics” don’t make any (human) sense. They can indicate a difference for which no social, cultural category can exist—which is kind of fun to explore in any case. [[link]](https://denten.plaintext.in/think.stack/time-and-topics)

- Why you should have ~3 essays on your site and how to operationalize them [[link]](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1235088344066842624)
    - You can use them as a proof-of-work in cold or coldish 1:1 reachouts like e.g. to hiring managers for jobs you want. It puts you *so far ahead* of the average reachout.
    - Whatever it is that you do professionally. This does not have to be rocket science; "Architecting a real-time chat application with NSQ and websockets" would be a great piece for a full-stack engineer, for example.
    - (Note how for a lot of jobs "I'm going to describe a very commonly used applicaiton/service/etc and you're going to walk through how you understand it with me" is a very literal interview question, so why not get ahead of the curve. Bonus: you'll be prepped as heck for that one.)
    - "I saw that FooCorp is hiring full stack engineers engineers. I love what you are doing with React these days; I've written about some of my experiences here: LINK. Would you like to chat about what working at FooCorp is like?"
    - As long as I’m giving proscriptive advice, your goal at the end of that call is: “I’m enthusiastic about working at FooCorp. Can you help me get the ball rolling?” or, if Jane has hiring authority, “What do you recommend as the next step for exploring working together?”
    - Virtually every company with a defined application process has a sidechannel for candidates that someone internally feels strongly about and you want to be in that sidechannel.

- How to do a DS phone screening (very good) [[link]](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/1198351229564440577)
    - I want to know that you've come across problems you'll experience on the job, and overcame them. I want to know what role you played if it was a group project.
    - I want to know how you decided what question to answer, and what approach to take. I want to know if you tried different tools or techniques, or had to learn something new in order to accomplish what you were attempting to do.
    - If you're describing a project you've done at work, be prepared to talk about it from different stakeholders' perspectives. Some might want to know your technical approach and model evaluation metrics.
    - Some might want to know *why* you were working on it, and what business value you provided.
    - It's ok to pause and ask, "Do you want me to continue and explain more?"
    - There are certain data science topics you should be prepared to give answers to that show that you've come across a topic. One example: How did you know your model was good? (with follow-up questions digging into possible model evaluation pitfalls)
    - So, maybe look at lists of common data science questions, narrow it down to the ones relevant to what's on your resume or what's in the job posting, and be prepared to answer those.
- Go to a conference to meet people, not attend talks [[link]](https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1196889061799055360)
    -  The main value is the people. Look up authors/speakers/Twitter in advance to see who's going and email them asking for a quick chat. Talk to everyone, especially those whose work isn't already famous.

- Questions to ask the interviewer(s):
  - How do data science decisions get made?
  - How is performance measured here?
- Questions to prepare for:
  - What’s your favorite machine learning algorithm? Alright, can you explain it to me?
  - You developed a new model that performs better than your old model currently in production. How do you determine whether you should switch the model in production? How do you go about it? Ans: Depends on how much the new model improved (on the biz problem, not necessarily the model metrics); would want to run in shadow mode for a while to test pipeline & dig more into results to verify no bias, bad results in specific categories, etc.

>one of my favorite pieces of advice was from FastAI’s Jeremy Howard. He told me to focus on making one really great project that showed off my skills. He says that so many people have many interesting but half-finished projects on github, and that it’s much better to have a single one that is really polished.

  - You're a data scientist at a large telecom company that has contracted a large consulting firm to build a model to predict customer churn for wireless contracts. Overall customer churn is 6% per year, and we want to use the model to target likely churners with offers. Consultants train a logistic regression `churn2018 ~ csat + geography + total_revenue_2018` where churn2018 is binary = 1 iff the customer churned in 2018, csat is the most recent score on a customer satisfaction survey, geography is a factor variable for customer location. They report that their model has 94% accuracy. Your boss wants you to review their methods before we she pays the consultants. 1. What clarifying questions would you ask the consultants about their model? 2. Should we pay?

> Suppose you are a data scientist: Chances are your Jupyter notebook has a pretty standard format. The first cells are used to build a DataFrame populated with data from a CSV file or a database query. Pandas pros can even do this in one single line as they know that the DataFrame constructor provides a lot of arguments. Typically this DataFrame has a few columns at first. And then “feature engineering” begins and creative-constructive chaos ensues: more columns are added subsequently to the dataset and it grows horizontally. Novices will be tempted to write for-loops to add more columns; if you are a more seasoned professional though you will squeeze some more juice from your machine and use vectorized operations instead. Practically this means that you use one-liners sequentially to define your columns as there’s probably already an implemented function you’re just calling and applying on each cell. You may still be thinking procedurally in your head (that for-loop temptation is still there) but in essence, you are doing declarative programming. You are not defining how your independent variable is calculated but rather what is its meaning: this preference for “what” instead of “how” is the essence of declarative programming.

- Don't call yourself a programmer [[link]](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
    - You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you.
    - Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.  If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.
    - You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with
    - Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly (see here).  Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.  The decisionmaker at a company knows he needs someone.  He tells his friends and business contacts.  One of them knows someone — family, a roommate from college, someone they met at a conference, an ex-colleague, whatever.  Introductions are made, a meeting happens, and they achieve agreement in principle on the job offer.  Then the resume/HR department/formal offer dance comes about.

    - get into causal inference! recommends Causal Inference by Miguel Hernán and Jamie
- Knowing the difference between inference and prediction; knowledge about research design (statistical bias, bad counterfactuals, measurement, generalization, validity); causality; statistics. [^f17592c2]
- Understand the business problem, go through data analysis, explain, show work via Github.[^33eac966]
- Be sure you know the handful of things that you can do better than most anyone else. Add something to that list every year. Make sure you can explain these things to non techies.[^f2f694c7]
- Be able to connect the machine learning model to the business impact. Think about what metrics the business uses to gauge the health of the business. Be able to communicate results in a usable way.
- Address things like: where to get the right data, how data can be bad and how to address that.
- Learn hierarchical bayesian inference models. [[example]](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/lin.pdf)
- Keep the portfolio simple. Pick a dataset, ask questions and explore the dataset and see how many you can answer with simple data visualizations and summaries of the distributions of data. Build reports that indicate possible answers to your questions, and communicate your exploratory findings. Come up with a single "real world" question that you can answer with this dataset, as if a boss asked you a business question. This can be put in a resume (1-line explanation) and talk about in an interview.
