Welcome to my guide to dealing with anxiety. I understand anxiety to be vastly disproportionate stress response to an environment lacking in danger cues. Hence, in this research note, I focus specifically on physical conditions that can catalyze a anxious state of mind. I ignore conventional, unsubstantiated advice that tells the afflicted to try positive-thinking, white-knuckling, and "grow a spine.

In better words than mine: "It's simply a subjective perception of non-specific fear caused by the brain's threat-response system needing a bit of tune up."

I've found it extremely helpful to think of anxiety as a fever descending. During anxious bouts, I often turn to "punishing" myself as a motivator to get out of it. Don't ask why, it made sense in my head (I still have to fight this impulse). This took the form of not showering or eating until I sucessfully fought off the anxiety. I've learnt that this view pathologizes anxiety as a character defect.

## Triggers
* The drop in progesterone has been conclusively linked to anxiety disorders. This is most sharply seen in post-partum women, when progesterone falls rapidly after birth. Hence the adage, pregnancy protects against panics. A milder version occurs during menstrual cycles, usually a few days (3?) before it begins.
*

In order of most effective to least:
* Breadth exercises
* Meditation

* Sleep (regular, 8 hours)
* Exercise
* Eat well (healthy, avoid caffeine & other triggers, don't starve)
* Reaching out to friends
* Mindfulness (Headspace)
* Writing (thought-stopping to end the cycle/flow of disruptive thoughts)
* Exposure to stressful situations
* Helping someone
* Therapy
* Medication
* Pulling an all-nighter to reset
* CBT

Panic attack, what to do?
* Ensure ventilation
* Sigh
* Deep breathing exercises
