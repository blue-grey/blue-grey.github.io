Using this [informative podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5mZWVkYnVybmVyLmNvbS9hYmNyYWRpby8xMHBlcmNlbnRoYXBwaWVy&episode=WFhKa3pjenFJUVcyZjhoQ1RUZUlXcWRpcDBCMnlHTEk&hl=en-CA&ved=2ahUKEwjVzaLDsKnnAhWFHM0KHSixBc8QieUEegQIARAE&ep=6) with Tara Brach to write a little something using prompts from it.

My top three fears as of today:
1. Ultimately not being able to land a data science job.
2. Being forced to choose between job security and relationship.
3. When employed, not having a sufficiently high status job relative to peers.

Some toxic behaviors I would like to eradicate:
1. Motivating myself through punishment (it never works)
2.
