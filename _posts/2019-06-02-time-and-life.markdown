Failure [[link]](https://itsonlychemo.wordpress.com/2019/05/02/failure/)
> When you fail all you have to do is start the next thing. You are not in a prison camp. Failure isn’t your guard. You aren’t scrubbing boots or breaking rocks.
Who cares if the others got there sooner or made it to a higher rock. You are not competing with them. You are competing with you.

Most decisions are reversible, start making more [[link]](https://cynthiabellmcgillis.com/2019/05/16/some-thoughts-on-working-more-effectively/?ck_subscriber_id=334907275)

>If one more 22-year-old writes to me and bemoans the years they've wasted and how it's too late to start anything new at this point, I am going to set something on fire. [[link]](https://twitter.com/hhavrilesky/status/1201928197626982400)

The best professionals I know simply have been at it for a long time. [[link]](https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1201275263528640512)

>You don’t need to be trying to convert people forcefully or preach at them. I find that a sincere curiosity about what people mean often goes a really long way. People get defensive when you attack them. But genuine questions linger with them for years and change them from inside [[link]](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1011457604692815872)

>I feel like “put yourself in the shoes of the people who have the ability to give you what you want, then work give them what they want” is still a dramatically underutilized frame for getting what you want. It applies to everything from dating to jobs. Foundational peopling 101. "What people profess to want" and "What people are believed to want" are not coextensive with "What people want" and "What people take specific actions to get" is a much better predictor were really, really important lessons for me.

Tyler Cowen Production Function (notes from a podcast):
"writing everyday
reading everyday
no tv
getting up early
having good sleep
having some strong habits

Need more norms that are building for the future, but not just art. Stay away from social media

Faustian bargain: got to accept the whole package

it's lazy to attack things. detach, don't get caught up in the enthusiasm and notice facts more."
