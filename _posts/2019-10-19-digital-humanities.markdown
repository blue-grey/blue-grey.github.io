> These researchers are digitally mapping Civil War battlefields to understand what role topography played in victory, using databases of thousands of jam sessions to track how musical collaborations influenced jazz, searching through large numbers of scientific texts and books to track where concepts first appeared and how they spread, and combining animation, charts and primary documents about Thomas Jefferson’s travels to create new ways to teach history.

  - Visible Prices (VP) is a digital humanities project, currently in development, for a collection of prices drawn from literary and historical sources in 18th and 19th century England. Users will be able to search for information relating to a specific good or service, or a specific amount of money. As I read and taught 18th and 19th century English literature, I noticed that references to specific prices for specific incomes, goods, services, and experiences appeared regularly in a variety of genres; and also, that these prices were all but invisible in the texts, and difficult for my students to understand, except in the most basic sense: Mr. Darcy makes more money than Mr. Bingley, and both men are better off than Jane Eyre.
