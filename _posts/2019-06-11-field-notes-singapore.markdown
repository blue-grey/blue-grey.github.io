How to visit Singapore:

The view from the top of Marina Bay sands hotel. You see the urban landscape, the HDBs, the ships.

At night, take the Esplanade/helix bridge/MBS/merlion walk. The MBS light show is pretty kitsch, but it's nice to sit and watch from the steps in front of the Esplanade. There's a tourist-friendly foodcourt called Makansutra: Gluttons By the Bay next to it.

The National Gallery is huge and is the old Supreme Court building. It has a significant and very interesting Southeast Asian art collection. The Asian Civilizations Museum is also fantastic.

Organize the trip around food. I cannot think of any other place in Southeast Asia (or Asia) that offers the same variety and quality at great prices.

Malay food: Geylang Serai (so authentic, most non-Malays don't even go there)
