Farnam Street did a [brilliant podcast interview](https://fs.blog/sue-johnson/) with Canadian pyschologist Sue Johnson. After that, I just had to read the [book](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/031611300X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?tag=amznca03-20&ie=UTF8&linkId=10ece4cb5fc43c44a0ecb3cb2434a1ed) that her fans rave about.

I enjoy her approach because it takes a meta-level analysis to fights. Not what is actually being said or done (although that is important too), but what sort of feedback loops couple fights are stuck in.

At the base of most fights is the problem of couples having disconnected emotionally. This stems from feeling emotionally unsafe. The unspoken questions being repeated, over and over, are: “Can I count on you, depend on you? Are you there for me? Will you respond to me when I need, when I call? Do I matter to you? Am I valued and accepted by you? Do you need me, rely on me?”

Individuals with insecure bonds (me) experience momentary blips very differently. It's overwhelming, a "primal panic". We react either by demanding more and more reassurance, or withdrawing to protect ourselves. These reactions to fear are unconsciously driven, but when used too many times, they contribute to an insecurity spiral that destabilizes the relationship.

It's very difficult to tune in to our partners' needs. These are just some reasons why:
1. Too focused on ourselves
2. Not trained in speaking language of attachment
3. Not sending clear messages about what we need or how much we care

Emotional responsiveness has three components:
1. Accessibility: Can I reach you?
2. Responsiveness: Can I rely on you to respond to me emotionally?
3. Engagement: Do I know you will value me and stay close?
Basically: are you there, are you with me?

EFT is thus seven conversations to strengthen these three. How do you assess your relationship through an attachment lens? I took this questionnaire:

**From your viewpoint, is your partner accessible to you?**
1. I can get my partner’s attention easily. **T** F
2. My partner is easy to connect with emotionally. **T** F
3. My partner shows me that I come first with him/her. **T** F
4. I am not feeling lonely or shut out in this relationship. **T** F
5. I can share my deepest feelings with my partner. He/she will listen. **T** F
From your viewpoint, is your partner responsive to you?
1. If I need connection and comfort, he/she will be there for me. **T** F
2. My partner responds to signals that I need him/her to come close. **T** F
3. I find I can lean on my partner when I am anxious or unsure. **T** F
4. Even when we fight or disagree, I know that I am important to my partner and we will find a way to come together. **T** F
5. If I need reassurance about how important I am to my partner, I can get it. **T** F

**Are you positively emotionally engaged with each other?**
1. I feel very comfortable being close to, trusting my partner. **T** F
2. I can confide in my partner about almost anything. **T** F
3. I feel confident, even when we are apart, that we are connected to each other. **T** F
4. I know that my partner cares about my joys, hurts, and fears. **T** F
5. I feel safe enough to take emotional risks with my partner. **T** F

All **Ts** :)

Some other questions I've worked through today:
1. Name two very concrete and specific things that a safe, accessible, responsive, and engaged lover in a relationship with you would do on a typical day and how those things would make you feel at that moment.
>Reach out for a hug, initiate a lot of physical touch that makes me feel comforted and powerfully reminded of her love. Ask to talk and catch up, even if it's to talk about something we need to fix, asking to talk always makes me feel purpose-led and gives me an opportunity to connect without distractions.

2. When you feel disconnected or alone in your present relationship, are you likely to get very emotional or even anxious and push your partner to respond? Or are you more likely to shut down and try not to feel your need to connect? Can you think of a time when this happened?”
> Very anxious and push for a response. See below lol.

3. Think of a time in your relationship when questions like “Are you there for me?” were hanging in the air unanswered and you wound up getting into a fight about a mundane problem.
> This is easy. The first two days after A moved away. My attempts to connect were basically trying to ask if I was still a priority while she explored new things, and although she was communicating her love for me, it wasn't explicitly answering my question. This made her feel unappreciated and left me increasingly sure I was being abandoned.

I think we do really well, because when I look at the EFT's three "demon dialogues", we often choose the correct responses even when they are really difficult to do.
1. Blaming the person at fault. One of us is usually good at sensing when we are trapped in a viscous cycle of blaming the other (I think usually me), and can go beyond our pride to be the first one to stop trying to gain the upper-hand, apologize and ask to reset the conversation.
2. "Protest polka", where one partner is actively protesting the disconnection, the other is withdrawing in protest from the implied criticism. I think we are exceptionally good at avoiding this. I cannot recall an recent incident where this dynamic played out. I've learnt that when one person is withdrawing, the response is not to give them space, but pursue them in a less blame-y way, with lots of praise and affirmation, so we can move forward to the actual thing. We are good at breaking the cycle with humour and acts of cuteness :)
3. Freeze and flee, when couples are in self-protection mode, detached without a love relationship, or any kind of emotional relationship.
