Watchman Nee's Sit, Walk Stand

1. Sit
> Christianity does not begin with walking; it begins with sitting...If at the outset we try to do anything, we get nothing; if we seek to attain something, we miss everything. For Christianity begins not with a big DO, but with a big DONE. Thus Ephesians opens with the statement that God has “blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ” (1:3) and we are invited at the very outset to sit down and enjoy what God has done for us; not to set out to try and attain it for ourselves.

> “Sitting” is an attitude of rest. Something has been finished, work stops, and we sit. It is paradoxical, but true, that we only advance in the Christian life as we learn first of all to sit down.

> So also in the spiritual realm, to sit down is simply to rest our whole weight— our load, ourselves, our future, everything—upon the Lord. We let him bear the responsibility and cease to carry it ourselves.

> It is not that we work for God, but that he works for us. God gives us our position of rest. He brings his Son’s finished work and presents it to us, and then he says to us, “Please sit” (ch’eng tso). His offer to us cannot, I think, be better expressed than in the words of the invitation to the great banquet: “Come; for all things are now ready” (Luke 14:17). Our Christian life begins with the discovery of what God has provided.

> God is waiting for your store of strength to be utterly exhausted before he can deliver you. Once you have ceased to struggle, he will do everything. God is waiting for you to despair.

2. Walk

> Nothing has done greater damage to our Christian testimony than our trying to be right and demanding right of others. We become preoccupied with what is and what is not right. We ask ourselves, Have we been justly or unjustly treated? and we think thus to vindicate our actions. But that is not our standard. The whole question for us is one of cross-bearing.

> With Him it is a question of His grace and not of right or wrong. But that is to be our standard also: “Forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you” (Eph. 4:32). “Right or wrong” is the principle of the Gentiles and tax gatherers.

> So, my brethren, don’t stand on your right. Don’t feel that because you have gone the second mile you have done what is just. The second mile is only typical of the third and the fourth. The principle is that of conformity to Christ. We have nothing to stand for, nothing to ask or demand. We have only to give. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He did not do so to defend our “rights”; it was grace that took Him there. Now, as His children, we try always to give others what is their due and more.
