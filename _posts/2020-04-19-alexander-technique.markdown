some scattered notes from my first (virtual) alexander technique workshop:

non judgemental awareness is curative

being comfortable staying in that uncertainty

the present moment only lasts three seconds, you can only go "oh there it is. oh there it is"

build space internally which can lead to space externally

pause before reacting the way you habitually do

in the end it comes down to saying no to a habit

the goal is to have choice whether you want to be in that position or not

homework:
- constructive rest (supine on the floor for 15 minutes, book under the head, no music. just notice. are you holding, controlling breathing. just watch and wait.)
- notice what you notice (best way into present movement): bring that awareness into real life vs as an intellectual exercise
