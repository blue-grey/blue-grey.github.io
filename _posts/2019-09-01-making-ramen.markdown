## Stock
1. Water (cover by 1 inch)
2. Kombu
3. dried porcini mushrooms
4. dried shiitake mushrooms
5. cabbage
6. leek
7. scallions
Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to simmer for 90 minutes.




## Tare
There are three categories of tare:
1. Shoyu (soy sauce)
2. Shio (salt-based)
3. Miso

Tare is made of salt and glutamic acid (umami). Some combinations:
- kombu + bonito


## Miso tare
- Miso of various types (totaling 2 cups, typically at least 50% white/kome miso. I generally blend 3 misos: a Shinshu, another white of some kind, and a nice Red or Wheat forward variant)
- 1.5 tbsp tahini
- 4-8 grated garlic cloves (entirely up to you)
- One two inch long piece of ginger, grated
- One half white onion, pureed
- 2 tbs soy sauce (though more if needed)
- 1 tbsp of sesame oil
- ichimi to taste (maybe half a teaspoon)
