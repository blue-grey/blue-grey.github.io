I tuned into the live webcast at MCC Toronto. The music has always drawn me in and it's incredible how watching from another country can still feel so powerfully intimate. 

Brent Hawkes was the guest speaker, following a series on the Lord's Prayer:
- When you are in pain, expand your sense of things. if you are a glass, become a lake.
- Expand who you are for the bitterness of life, so you can handle it.
- God in me and God through me for our world. God in us and God through us for our world.
- We are the delivery system for heaven on earth. Not just through prayer.
- Thy dominion come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
