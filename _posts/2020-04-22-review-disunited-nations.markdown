- pro/anti-trump is not an accurate framework for understanding US
- sweeping history of age of global order under US rule (post WWII)
- US navy + nuclear = single integrated economic system (Bretton Woods)
- post-Cold War, US has been in retreat (w/ some exceptions), no clear strategy
- US policing global trade routes, Cold War allies, providing a market for exports, financing etc without getting deference

Triggers
- Europeans launch Euro against American financial dominance 
- Chinese claiming territory in Pacific
- Saudis…well, radical-export strategy
+ many other offending countries
- “Canada is just so damn snarky. All. The. Goddamn. Time.”

Now
- US least integrated major economy  
- retrenchment preceded Trump and will continue
- global system is breaking up

Winners
-

Losers
- crude oil production/trade
- food production/trade


Projections
- new age of disorder w/o US overwatch
- Neo-imperialism returns to Europe
- East-Asian shipping conflicts to rise
- general fighting over the Persian Gulf
- to dominate, you need to bribe like the US did (China is doing the opposite)
- most likely scenario: no global hegemon, multipolar

Chinese obstacles
- China does not have a history of bribing allies
- Bad ties with: Korea, Taiwan, Central Asia, Japan, India
- (pandemic has accelerated this, mostly due to Chinese foreign policy idociy)
- No dice with Russia (esp during communism)
- Contrast Vietnamese perceptions of US vs China
- no global naval powers (many ships, but short-range)
- OBOR meant to secure friendly ports, but this has now failed
- US order worked bc it opened its market to everyone, net importer
- Chinese has the greatest debt run-up in history owing to growth strategy (the numbers made me cold), the financial crash will be enormous
- China cannot offer its internal market to get allies, bc it is dependent on everyone else’s to make it work
- and, the US is the world’s largest consumer market (world’s “sink” for global supply)
- Yuan not a credible alternative to US dollar (see 2010 effort to internationalize), neither are the Euro, Yen, Pound
- 70% of global currencies are linked to the US dollar, US fed bailed out many foreign central banks during financial crises
- but the US is also no longer able to keep its commitments in a modern global economy either

What if the Chinese use the stick (aka the British model)?
- British navy, geography made it very tough to attack (I still don’t fully understand why this is true)
- China is a constrained land power: no insulation from Russia, India Thailand, Vietnam
- Difficult to project power in Central Asia bc of geography
- Both Koreas are pretty tough
- British navy developed discipline and market acumen as it was not a state-dominated effort
- China is a land power, the navy is subordinate to its army, 0 modern experience in a war (historically, it did have naval expertise but that’s been lost)
- Navies are extremely expensive relative to army and air
- To recap, to be a global power you need these simultaneously: a large navy that can operate far from shore, large airforce, large army, intelligence etc etc

Zeihan poses an interesting question: forget global hegemony, can China can even hold itself together as a country?
- American midwest has the world’s largest navigable interconnected waterway, which happens to overlap the largest piece of arable, flat, temperate-zone land (v v cheap to export food abroad and domestically, also important for cultural unification)
- American system bounded by dessert, mountains lakes from Mexico and Canada. Then Atlantic and Pacific separate it from Asia and Europe.
- This combination is rare in the world
- Yangtze Valley river (important for economy) is away from northern China plain where agricultural is
- Shanghai sits at southern bank of Yangtze, is the financial centre to northern Beijing’s political centre
- Sichuan at the head of the Yangtze is self-sufficient, as rich as Shanghai, and culturally distinct — a problem for northern China. It historically has been a trouble point
- central China has many hostile ethnicities (Xinjiang, Tibet)
- political unification under centralized Han control has been only < 3 centuries. Hence a lot of energy spent on propaganda

Food security
- very little arable land per person
- China is a net importer of oil & natural gas, and rice, beef, pork, fish, soy…
- alot of our food is imported

Demographics
- Almost all advanced countries are aging fast, which means fewer workers and fewer consumers…how to absorb all products to produce?
- Everyone is becoming more dependent on the international system while it is breaking down
- France, NZ, US may face aging but it can still be reversed
- China will have a higher median age than the US very soon, and this gap will increase
- large share of unmarried males = social stability?
- can China pull in immigrants? Has trouble conflating citizen with ethnicity

Energy
- US became a net exporter of crude oil bc of shale tech
- green tech not a solution outside of US
- China imports oil through Russia, which has a history of playing it against consumers
- this is why navies are important, most oil trade is over water
- safer to get oil from Persian Gulf to US than to China

China is a “full unfurling fucking disaster”
