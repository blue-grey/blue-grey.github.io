>“In my son's eyes I see the ambition that had first hurled me across the world. In a few years he will graduate and pave his way, alone and unprotected. But I remind myself that he has a father who is still living, a mother who is happy and strong. Whenever he is discouraged I tell him that if I can survive on three continents than there is no obstacle he cannot conquer. While the astronauts, heroes forever, spent mere hours on the moon, I have remained in this new world for nearly thirty years. I know that my achievement is quite ordinary. I am not the only man to seek his fortune far from home, and certainly I am not the first. Still, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept. As ordinary as it all appears, there are times when it is beyond my imagination.”

Excerpt From: Jhumpa Lahiri. “Interpreter of Maladies.”

Grace Lavery wrote a brilliant piece on cosmopolitanism. I can't quote all of it here.
>"That’s fourteen cities over which I find it difficult not to exert a personal claim, to feel like I am personally welcomed when I land. It’s the arrogance of the rootless cosmopolitan to flatter herself that some good luck finding a lunch spot in 2007, now equates to “local knowledge,” and indeed the choices I have made about how to work and live have really made a strong experience of localism accessible to me, but lacking one I develop these strange nonce claims about these fourteen cities, all of which are somehow illegitimate, and all of which mark me as one kind of interloper or another - migrant, gentrifier, scholarship boy, tourist, transsexual, gaijin."
