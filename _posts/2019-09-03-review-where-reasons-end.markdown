The book is a dialogue between the narrator and her son, after he commits suicide at sixteen, just like in real life for Yiyun Li.

I won't pretend to understand fully what Rachel Cusk achieves in her [review](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/07/18/case-of-yiyun-li/) of *Where Reasons End*, but I have to jot down the moment near the end where she nails the eerie tone of a not-quite-fiction-not-quite-autobiography.

From the review:
>Where Reasons End is a work of respect, the kind of respect few parents are capable of feeling for their child. Li is a far-more-than-good-enough-mother. She has broken the chain of repetition, and from there it is one very small and very hard step to reach love and respect for oneself:

Cusk then quotes Li:
>We can always be good, do better, try our best, but how perfect can we be before we can love ourselves and let others love us? And who, my dear child, has taken the word lovable out of your dictionary and mine, and replaced it with perfect? I wish you had made me an enemy, I said, rather than yourself. Mothers, I thought, would be perfect for that role.

>You can't be that for me, Mommy, Nikolai said. I've found a perfect enemy in myself.

I actually did not get much out of the book and skimmed most of it. I'm not one for wordplay or etymology (which the narrator and her son do a lot of), and there wasn't really a plot. I did enjoy this part, when the narrator explains why even as she has been preparing for the possibility of losing him for as long as she has been a parent, it did not deter her from having children since she had hope. Nikolai tries to logic this way into a "so then you shouldn't be sad since you knew this was coming". But of course that's silly. As the narrator explains:
> Because preparing is not experiencing. Pre-living is not living. I will be sad today and tomorrow, a week from now, a year from now. I will be sad forever.

I found out today that one of my top ten favourite authors, Jade Sharma, committed suicide back in July. It was only publicised now. The [literary eulogy](https://catapult.co/community/stories/remembering-catapult-instructor-jade-sharma) suggest one reason might have been due to a fatal strain of perfectionism. This, even though, or perhaps especially so, when her debut and only novel, *Problems*, was critically acclaimed upon publication.
> I don’t think that praise ever felt real to her. I wish she would have believed it, but an editor—a friend—can only do so much.

It's very strange to read this two events together. Perfectionism is one particularly nasty demon that I personally feel responsible for staving off in A.

A while ago, when she remarked, out of delusion, that she sometimes wished that her partner would also be in the literary world, I would have laughed it off if not for the general seriousness of the conversation.

Literary people and coders have a lot in common. They nitpick and obsess over syntax and style. They can spend long hours locked in a flow state, feverishly trying to produce The Next Great Thing. But there is one key difference.

Coders don't necessarily have the luxury of time. It's about being the first to market. So any perfectionistic instinct is killed by the need to ship yesterday. Workflows like MVP, lean, agile all work towards this end.

This is my theory for why I can work so differently in both fields (as a minor writer of economics and foreign policy papers). I don't feel chained by dread towards the blank page, or overwhelmed thinking of all the research that has to be done before even writing. I first calculate a baseline result, then iterate until the time is up. It feels much less emotionally taxing in one, very specific way.

I feel grief when perfectionism proves fatal. It cannot be underestimated. I'm really proud of A for going as far as she has, and I see it as a huge advantage for me not to be in the same field. I hope she can understand better, or be reminded why, in this post.
