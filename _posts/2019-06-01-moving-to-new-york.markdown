My partner is moving to NYC for school. Naturally, I've started compiling of things to see, eat, and do over the next year.

**See**

On my list are a few of the usual suspects:
  - [The Guggenheim](https://www.guggenheim.org/)
  - [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions) (will just miss a very cool [Chinese landscapes exhibition](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/streams-and-mountains))
  - [Whitney](https://whitney.org/exhibitions) (the Mehretu exhibition looks great, and their collection looks amazing)
  - Doyer Street
  - [Printed Matter](https://www.printedmatter.org/) (art bookstore)
  - [Webster Hall](https://www.websterhall.com/): dancing
  - [Joyface](https://joyface.nyc/): dancing

**Of Note**
- NY diners are mostly gone because their large menus make them much more expensive to start and run compared to high-end restaurants [[link]](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20151025/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/151029907/dark-times-for-diners)]
