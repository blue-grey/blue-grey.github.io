[Joe Hudson: Frameworks for Self-Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyEoQy4rcBw)
- progress is circular and linear
- [thread](https://twitter.com/msutherl/status/1237453582665789440) I got it from
- every epiphany is a rut
- if you're on the path and going back and forth, you're making progress. it's a pendulation and it's useful.  
- Emotional framework he uses:
    - recognize you have emotions, and that there are subtleties in emotional states
    - we try to manage them (try to be happy, try not to get mad)
    - get into inquiry about the emotions (most people don't get there): how dense is it? how does it move? stop resisting it.  
    - now you can relate to your emotions differently (what happens if you treat your anger with deep loving care? what does it want?)
    - get into the point of loving all your emotions!
    - If we don't feel that emotion, we keep repeating that pattern you want to change in your life.

>One of the great insights of psychoanalysis is that you never really want an object, you only want the wanting, which means the solution is to set your sights on an impossible ideal and work hard to reach it.

>My biggest revelation of the last decade was about how high my anxiety/neuroticism were & learning how to manage/reduce them. Feel like I spent the last 5 years just learning how to breathe.

the actual #1 most important thing you need to do when supporting someone else emotionally is to just *accept whatever is happening for them*: rest if the thread is great
