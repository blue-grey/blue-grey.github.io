### Crying
[The Lost Art of Crying](https://nibrasi.co.uk/the-lost-art-of-crying): lots of resources at the end to therapeutic frameworks

> The guidance was essentially an hour of  "feel your feelings" Stop spending all your time reading things online to avoid your feelings. Stop intellectualising everything to avoid your feelings. Just fucking sit down and feel your feelings sometimes.

## Shared Experiences
Thread: have you privately/personally experienced a month in your life that was longer than March 2020? I'd love to hear all about it. illness or loss of a loved one? divorce? depression? [[link]](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1244581602723676160)

In the tech crash of ‘00-‘02, I was super f’d. I was broke, desperate, and had collections agencies literally screaming at me on the phone. Despite that, it took me too long to realize something that ultimately saved me: There is no shame in asking family and friends for help.

Almost every late 20s/early 30s millennial I know was finally getting their shit together. I could cry if I wasn’t so angry. [[link]](https://twitter.com/JayElHarris/status/1245458636123619330)

## Parenting

Read "Unlocking the Emotional Brain" to understand intergenerational trauma [[link]](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1184593604620107776)

You can't save your kids from pain, there are no shortcuts [[link]](https://twitter.com/maiab/status/1244104502359339008)

I think investing in ordering around your kids less is usually very high leverage for parental wellbeing. [[link]](https://twitter.com/diviacaroline/status/1251238932609503232)

We’ll know we’re growing when we let God replace who we thought we’d be with who He thought we’d be. [[link]](https://twitter.com/bobgoff/status/1232678065664184320)

If you feel that you're consistently falling behind relative to your planned work output, consider that instead of having a "productivity problem" you might just be bad at planning. [[link]](https://twitter.com/economeager/status/1252942946363674627)

This moment of social distancing is pressuring a combo of stressors: difficulty of being with one's own thoughts, interruption of predictable routine/expanding uncertainty about the future, loss of material security, media overexposure, empathic overwhelm, etc. 2/ [[link]](https://twitter.com/jaysunkei/status/1242302919703179264)


so like a lot of weird Millennial practices are ways to "prove" to yourself that you're having a good time [on secret threat of psychic-parental retribution], regardless of whether you're actually experiencing pleasure (release of tension) [[link]](https://twitter.com/qorprate/status/1252040449235341316)

I hate that being self-aware is totally different from actually being able to change your behavior which is why therapy quickly helps people understand self-destructive patterns but they still stay in therapy repeating those patterns for years & years.

incredible thread I empathize deeply with [[link]](https://twitter.com/maybegray/status/1248244744292950027)
> what's ur best advice for shifting habits gently? I've tried for years to rebuild routines I had at my best but b/w life stuff/feeling dependent on coping mechs & approaching myself around it all w a lot of hostility I got nowhere & developed a v bad relationship w structure (with lots of humour and tenderness!) I'm noticing myself tear up when I look at books on habit formation, I am probably underestimating what a powerful obstacle shame is to making positive changes for myself. I used to be v on top of things and I very closely identified myself with that level of competence so when I went through a series of things that eventually added up to being more than I could cope with, I lost that competence and it felt like losing myself. there's blame now b/w the over-achiever I used to be & the bruised weirdo I am. Bruised weirdo knows over-achiever relied on lots of naivete & self-denial & resents her for her sense of superiority. Over-achiever got love for her service & thinks bruised weirdo ruined our life. my past attempts to rebuild mostly take over-achiever's side & amount to attempts to be her again even tho it's impossible, there's infrastructure that was load-bearing for that identity that I'm no longer compatible with, it just further bruises bruised weirdo that I keep trying. both sides probably need to feel forgiven in their role in my life's current state & the disparity b/w it & where I expected to be in life at this age before they'll be willing to work together & stop picking on each other. I can't change from a place of feeling ruined. an insight from having pulled the Devil this morning- both prisoners are actually comfortable w/ or blind to their self-limitation but since they can see the other's chains they can project feeling trapped at one another w/o pushing either of them to see clearly & blame the Devil

this is a thing that scares me and so far my patch is to only make relational commitments with people who are also committed to self-development [[link]](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1249331901854175234)

'Self discipline' is a patch for being conflicted about what you want to do.
Often, productive people are interpreted as 'having discipline': able to force themselves to do the work even when it's unpleasant. But creative productivity only ever works in *spite* of that. "Discipline is remembering what you want." When that works, it's not 'discipline'; it's getting less conflicted. The real answer to productivity and motivation is to resolve the conflicts you have. Once unconflicted about what to do, even hard work is effortless, motivation-wise. (And fun. #ReasonIsFun) It becomes effortful to *not* do it. It pulls you in and demands you keep working. Discipline is fighting yourself. Wasted energy. Wasted creativity. Put that instead into figuring out what you actually most want. Solve problems in doing what you want with reason, not force.

## Meditation

Reading an interview with Jonathan Young who worked extensively with Joseph Campbell, who reportedly read 6 hours a day. Campbell was always talking about God and the supernatural and so people would ask him if he prayed or meditated. He'd respond "I underline sentences." [[link]](https://twitter.com/thejessicadore/status/1248763441369591809)

my partner teaching me to stop reading people's subtext and to operate like there is no problem unless a person tells you otherwise truly freed me from the mental prison of trying to guess/interpret/micro-manage/process people's emotions for them. that is no longer my ministry.

## [Joe Hudson: Frameworks for Self-Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyEoQy4rcBw)
- I got it from [thread](https://twitter.com/msutherl/status/1237453582665789440)

David Beckworth's way of thinking about development
- victim (being done to us)
- manifester (doing things aka Tony Robbins)
- channel (things being done through us)
- being (it is us)
- These steps: you can't get past manifester if you think you are doing it. Because self-development says you're "doing", you "should". If you can get past the "will", "should", then it's self-realization. Understanding yourself.
    - To clarify the difference between manifester and channel:
        - still the concept that you're doing it
        - you have to drop, blame for yourself
        - e.g. artists take drugs to reduce self-judgement, remove critical voice in head in order to create

This ^ is a framework in general:
- Frameworks are great but also a trap, they're a map but not the terrain
- self-development is like a spiral
- our paths are circular and linear
- you can be in victim, manifester, and channel, not just graduated from manifester
- at some point there's a dropping in wanting to know where you are on the path at all, because why would you want that when you can enjoy where you are?
- we can convince ourselves we're in a different place too

The benefits of self-development? Joy, ease. The cost? Might cost you everything, you can become very sensitive to what you're working on, be sensitive to dysfunction that you need to lean into and embrace that intensity (can be painful).
- self development is considered a death
- your ego has to go (positive and negative views of self)
- a process of letting go vs. gaining something in order to get joy

Frameworks:
- every framework has its own trap
- cognitive development frameworks
    - spiral dynamics
    - cosmic consciousness
    - stages
    - every epiphany is a rut
        - a thought was helpful for understanding a concept, is also a rut just waiting to happen
    - deconstruction is the best use of the intellect, to see through everything and move beyond what we can see
- if you're intellectually driven, the intellectual road is the least helpful
    - go emotional, the biggest impact is the quickest
- your guide is internal knowing

Very few emotional frameworks out there:
- Bioenergetics, Alexander Lowen M.D framework
- Another framework is unnamed and not written down anywhere:
    - recognize you have emotions, and that there are subtleties in emotional states (not many recognize this, linear and circular)
    - we try to manage them (try to be happy, try not to get mad)
    - get into inquiry about the emotions (most people don't get there): how dense is it? how does it move? stop resisting it. what is it physically like to have that emotion? where does it end?  
    - now you can relate to your emotions differently (what happens if you treat your anger with deep loving care? what does it happen if you ignore it? what does it want? anger can be determination, clarity)
    - get to the point of loving the emotional state you're in. you think that what you're trying to get to is happiness, no! it's more a joy in whatever state is happening. I'm sad and I fucking love it. that love transforms it into something that is it and is different.
    - hence, this framework is about getting into the point of loving all your emotions
    - If we don't feel that emotion, we keep repeating that pattern we want to change in our life. We were taught the opposite, to not feel our emotions.

Pitfalls
  - you're never done, looking for being done is detrimental
  - trying, shoulds, wanting to get ahead actually slows you down, let go of that
  - blame for anything is not useful
  - people on the path, early on, they feel like they're making a lot progress but nothing's changed: but that's how we learn, we pendulate, we go back and forth and that is progress. this pendulation is useful.
  - elation (re: success) is not progress. e.g. try to feel exactly how you felt when you were 20 and leaving for college, you can't remember that state. we're constantly comparing the state that we're in to a state we can't remember and that slows us down.
  - right before a breakthrough, there's a lot of fear, the oh shit. you can't make sense of anything anymore. but that's a good sign.
  - always point back to yourself as the source of wisdom!
  - do not go with any teacher with any judgement

Others
- What is it like to sit down for ten minutes and enjoy the shit out of your breath?
- Our trauma often leads us to fixing other people instead of fixing ourselves. The best work we can do for them is fix ourselves. The most compassionate thing is to find your own awakening
- Your trauma needs to be loved as is, it doesn't need to be fixed.
- Trauma was created in relationship, it can be healed by it. Instead of it being a source of shame, it can be loved.
- Should you journal? Only if you enjoy it. If it challenges you from time to time, even better. Some friction is good to learn/love deeper
- You can't get someone else to love themselves. Start with asking yourself how to love someone who doesn't love themselves. Meet people where they're at. Love them unconditionally, as that's what makes them love themselves.

>One of the great insights of psychoanalysis is that you never really want an object, you only want the wanting, which means the solution is to set your sights on an impossible ideal and work hard to reach it.

the actual #1 most important thing you need to do when supporting someone else emotionally is to just *accept whatever is happening for them*: rest if the thread is great
