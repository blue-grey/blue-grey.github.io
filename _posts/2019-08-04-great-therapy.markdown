### Crying
[The Lost Art of Crying](https://nibrasi.co.uk/the-lost-art-of-crying): lots of resources at the end to therapeutic frameworks

[QC's sob thread](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1246952231963742208)

> The guidance was essentially an hour of  "feel your feelings" Stop spending all your time reading things online to avoid your feelings. Stop intellectualising everything to avoid your feelings. Just fucking sit down and feel your feelings sometimes.

## Shared Experiences
Thread: have you privately/personally experienced a month in your life that was longer than March 2020? I'd love to hear all about it. illness or loss of a loved one? divorce? depression? [[link]](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1244581602723676160)

In the tech crash of ‘00-‘02, I was super f’d. I was broke, desperate, and had collections agencies literally screaming at me on the phone. Despite that, it took me too long to realize something that ultimately saved me: There is no shame in asking family and friends for help.

Almost every late 20s/early 30s millennial I know was finally getting their shit together. I could cry if I wasn’t so angry. [[link]](https://twitter.com/JayElHarris/status/1245458636123619330)


## Parenting
Twitter thread on difficult relationship with dads [[link]](https://twitter.com/AJA_Cortes/status/1241744666627674112)

Read "Unlocking the Emotional Brain" to understand intergenerational trauma [[link]](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1184593604620107776)

You can't save your kids from pain, there are no shortcuts [[link]](https://twitter.com/maiab/status/1244104502359339008)

I think investing in ordering around your kids less is usually very high leverage for parental wellbeing. [[link]](https://twitter.com/diviacaroline/status/1251238932609503232)

so like a lot of weird Millennial practices are ways to "prove" to yourself that you're having a good time [on secret threat of psychic-parental retribution], regardless of whether you're actually experiencing pleasure (release of tension) [[link]](https://twitter.com/qorprate/status/1252040449235341316)

I hate that being self-aware is totally different from actually being able to change your behavior which is why therapy quickly helps people understand self-destructive patterns but they still stay in therapy repeating those patterns for years & years.

incredible thread I empathize deeply with [[link]](https://twitter.com/maybegray/status/1248244744292950027)
> what's ur best advice for shifting habits gently? I've tried for years to rebuild routines I had at my best but b/w life stuff/feeling dependent on coping mechs & approaching myself around it all w a lot of hostility I got nowhere & developed a v bad relationship w structure (with lots of humour and tenderness!) I'm noticing myself tear up when I look at books on habit formation, I am probably underestimating what a powerful obstacle shame is to making positive changes for myself. I used to be v on top of things and I very closely identified myself with that level of competence so when I went through a series of things that eventually added up to being more than I could cope with, I lost that competence and it felt like losing myself. there's blame now b/w the over-achiever I used to be & the bruised weirdo I am. Bruised weirdo knows over-achiever relied on lots of naivete & self-denial & resents her for her sense of superiority. Over-achiever got love for her service & thinks bruised weirdo ruined our life. my past attempts to rebuild mostly take over-achiever's side & amount to attempts to be her again even tho it's impossible, there's infrastructure that was load-bearing for that identity that I'm no longer compatible with, it just further bruises bruised weirdo that I keep trying. both sides probably need to feel forgiven in their role in my life's current state & the disparity b/w it & where I expected to be in life at this age before they'll be willing to work together & stop picking on each other. I can't change from a place of feeling ruined. an insight from having pulled the Devil this morning- both prisoners are actually comfortable w/ or blind to their self-limitation but since they can see the other's chains they can project feeling trapped at one another w/o pushing either of them to see clearly & blame the Devil

this is a thing that scares me and so far my patch is to only make relational commitments with people who are also committed to self-development [[link]](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1249331901854175234)

'Self discipline' is a patch for being conflicted about what you want to do.
Often, productive people are interpreted as 'having discipline': able to force themselves to do the work even when it's unpleasant. But creative productivity only ever works in *spite* of that. "Discipline is remembering what you want." When that works, it's not 'discipline'; it's getting less conflicted. The real answer to productivity and motivation is to resolve the conflicts you have. Once unconflicted about what to do, even hard work is effortless, motivation-wise. (And fun. #ReasonIsFun) It becomes effortful to *not* do it. It pulls you in and demands you keep working. Discipline is fighting yourself. Wasted energy. Wasted creativity. Put that instead into figuring out what you actually most want. Solve problems in doing what you want with reason, not force.

## Meditation

Reading an interview with Jonathan Young who worked extensively with Joseph Campbell, who reportedly read 6 hours a day. Campbell was always talking about God and the supernatural and so people would ask him if he prayed or meditated. He'd respond "I underline sentences."

my partner teaching me to stop reading people's subtext and to operate like there is no problem unless a person tells you otherwise truly freed me from the mental prison of trying to guess/interpret/micro-manage/process people's emotions for them. that is no longer my ministry.

[Joe Hudson: Frameworks for Self-Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyEoQy4rcBw)
- progress is circular and linear
- [thread](https://twitter.com/msutherl/status/1237453582665789440) I got it from
- every epiphany is a rut
- if you're on the path and going back and forth, you're making progress. it's a pendulation and it's useful.  
- Emotional framework he uses:
    - recognize you have emotions, and that there are subtleties in emotional states
    - we try to manage them (try to be happy, try not to get mad)
    - get into inquiry about the emotions (most people don't get there): how dense is it? how does it move? stop resisting it.  
    - now you can relate to your emotions differently (what happens if you treat your anger with deep loving care? what does it want?)
    - get into the point of loving all your emotions!
    - If we don't feel that emotion, we keep repeating that pattern you want to change in your life.

>One of the great insights of psychoanalysis is that you never really want an object, you only want the wanting, which means the solution is to set your sights on an impossible ideal and work hard to reach it.

If you go to therapy quote tweet this with the best thing you learned at therapy that way everyone else can get free therapy [[link]](https://twitter.com/CarolineMoss/status/1198748131556499456)

what if therapies start out effective but people adapt to them over time

>My biggest revelation of the last decade was about how high my anxiety/neuroticism were & learning how to manage/reduce them. Feel like I spent the last 5 years just learning how to breathe.

the actual #1 most important thing you need to do when supporting someone else emotionally is to just *accept whatever is happening for them*: rest if the thread is great
