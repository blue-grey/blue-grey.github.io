["Why is it that at night we get the urge to get our lives together, but lose the urge when we wake up in the morning?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ejg3sv/why_is_it_that_at_night_we_get_the_urge_to_get/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&ck_subscriber_id=334907275)

Best answer:
> There are 3 people that are you. Yesterday you, today you, and tomorrow you. You are ashamed of yesterday you, and how they didn't accomplish enough. Today you sees this and wants to do better. But today you is also tired from thinking and working all day. Today you wants to be productive and plan how to be better than it was today, and better than yesterday you was. The problem is that "today you" is simply handing off all of their plans to tomorrow you, not actually accomplishing them. So tomorrow, today you wakes up, and realizes theres a bunch of shit someone else wants them to do, but also that they aren't here to force you to do it. Today you has a bunch of stuff on their plate already, and doesn't have the time or energy to think about someone else's grand plans for the future. And the cycle repeats. * Ashamed might not be the right word. My meaning is that we want today and tomorrow to be better than yesterday, and sometimes get down on ourselves and our ability to change our lives because we remember our past failures to do so.
