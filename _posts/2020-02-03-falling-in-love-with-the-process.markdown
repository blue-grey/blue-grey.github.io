TLDR: "Here's the only productivity tip you'll ever need: do the most important thing first each day. Sounds simple. No one does it."

There's this great [post](https://www.luca-dellanna.com/solving-the-sources-of-your-problems/?ck_subscriber_id=334907275) on productivity (most are pretty shit).

Some takeaways in the same vein:

- There is always a step, no matter how small, which can be done towards what you want to achieve, and there is no excuse for not taking it today.
- You do not have to be comfortable with something in order to do it; rather, the other way around: doing it will make you comfortable doing it, and eventually enjoying it.
- “When you are starting something, your goal should be consistency” – @MavTraveler. Making a step every day (and ensuring it is in made in the right direction) is much more important than how big the step is.
- Everything which you did today which took time away from what you wanted to do to improve yourself and your condition is an addiction, and has to be treated accordingly. Denying this truth will prevent you from realizing your addiction is a source of problems, and has to be treated first.
- The quality and quantity of the opportunities which will present in front of you always match the value you can provide to them. This is true for love, work, friendship, everything. Working on yourself is the best way to increase your opportunities.
- If you are not taking care of yourself, life will not take care of you.
