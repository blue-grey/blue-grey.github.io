## A Reading List

Dodie Bellamy's [[My Mixed Marriage]](https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/06/20/my-mixed-marriage/)
>As I discover more and more about sexual practice in the decades before Stonewall, I marvel at the fluidity of queer behavior: how and why so many gay men slept with women, how many straight men had sex with gay mentors, why the theatrical role playing of butch/femme, top/bottom, continues to speak to us with such resonance and force. Sexuality is a vector of impulses, some acted upon, others not. Through my relationship with Kevin, I’ve certainly expanded my own range of sexual possibilities. I suspect it’s always been that way in mixed marriages like my own. Even in the most chaste “white marriage,” I can’t imagine that there wasn’t a sexual attraction. You don’t have to do the deed for it to be real.

>My top advice for youngsters as we embark on a new and uncertain decade: don’t marry anyone who expects to maintain a middle class or higher standard of living.

"The problem most people have with marriages that fail is that they go in thinking, "This person will make me happy." The fuck they will." "You aren't signing on for happiness. You are signing on for sharing human life, and a human life is a complete chaotic crazy mess."
