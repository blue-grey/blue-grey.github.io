## A Reading List

Dodie Bellamy's [[My Mixed Marriage]](https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/06/20/my-mixed-marriage/)
>As I discover more and more about sexual practice in the decades before Stonewall, I marvel at the fluidity of queer behavior: how and why so many gay men slept with women, how many straight men had sex with gay mentors, why the theatrical role playing of butch/femme, top/bottom, continues to speak to us with such resonance and force. Sexuality is a vector of impulses, some acted upon, others not. Through my relationship with Kevin, I’ve certainly expanded my own range of sexual possibilities. I suspect it’s always been that way in mixed marriages like my own. Even in the most chaste “white marriage,” I can’t imagine that there wasn’t a sexual attraction. You don’t have to do the deed for it to be real.

>What he does focus on, and what Alanis focuses on, is the concept of provisioning. “Provisioning,” a word I had never before heard in my life before our conversation, is simply a variation on what it means to provide, in a way designed to strip our ideas of how fathers are conditioned to provide for their families, which usually means financially. What does your partner need that isn’t money? Can you read your partner well enough to know what you need to provide for them before they have to ask for it?
