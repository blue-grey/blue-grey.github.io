## A Reading List

Dodie Bellamy's [[My Mixed Marriage]](https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/06/20/my-mixed-marriage/)
>As I discover more and more about sexual practice in the decades before Stonewall, I marvel at the fluidity of queer behavior: how and why so many gay men slept with women, how many straight men had sex with gay mentors, why the theatrical role playing of butch/femme, top/bottom, continues to speak to us with such resonance and force. Sexuality is a vector of impulses, some acted upon, others not. Through my relationship with Kevin, I’ve certainly expanded my own range of sexual possibilities. I suspect it’s always been that way in mixed marriages like my own. Even in the most chaste “white marriage,” I can’t imagine that there wasn’t a sexual attraction. You don’t have to do the deed for it to be real.

>What he does focus on, and what Alanis focuses on, is the concept of provisioning. “Provisioning,” a word I had never before heard in my life before our conversation, is simply a variation on what it means to provide, in a way designed to strip our ideas of how fathers are conditioned to provide for their families, which usually means financially. What does your partner need that isn’t money? Can you read your partner well enough to know what you need to provide for them before they have to ask for it?

>My top advice for youngsters as we embark on a new and uncertain decade: don’t marry anyone who expects to maintain a middle class or higher standard of living. They will seriously hinder your ability to adapt to unstable times ahead. [[link]](https://twitter.com/greenwoodae/status/1213100173007695877)

"The problem most people have with marriages that fail is that they go in thinking, "This person will make me happy." The fuck they will." "You aren't signing on for happiness. You are signing on for sharing human life, and a human life is a complete chaotic crazy mess."

> This is a very common emotional trap that married people fall into: they confuse their own private avoidance of feelings with an absence of feeling for the other person...In your current state of focusing on your husband and on FIXING your relationship, you’re in danger of believing that his numbness means he doesn’t love you enough. Let go of that story right now. This moment in your lives together is very unique, and it isn’t personal. Even if your husband said to you, “I don’t know how I feel anymore,” under your current conditions, I wouldn’t necessarily take that personally. I know that sounds fucking INSANE, but the man is trying to avoid mourning his mother. That is a specific, life-changing event. It is exceedingly difficult to show up for someone else when you’re going through that. And now the world is upside down. You’re going to have to take a deep breath and dig deep to keep yourself feeling good and safe and calm under these conditions, okay?


I love transparency in relationships, platonic or romantic. I don't wanna have to ask you how you feel about me. I wanna see it, feel it, and know it. [[link]](https://twitter.com/Eyedalis/status/1242138915487780866)
