## Quotes

"Just think how much you are saving: what’s really scarce in life is your time and the mere willingness to get up and go. Just do it." - Tyler Cowen

"We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent." Aristotle [[link]](http://www.constitution.org/ari/ethic_02.htm)

"“If you don’t have a good empirical strategy for identifying causal effects, then big data will just give you a more precise wrong answer.” [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/IlliniBizDean/status/1025494581281009664)

"Well, that is only true at the margin" [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/sherrirose/status/1017151631505461249)

"“All the benefits in life come from compound interest — relationships, money, habits — anything of importance.” [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/LingleScott/status/1000228960658231296)

"Most people starting out are worried about quality, when they should focus on quantity. Publish something every week for a year, and then you'll just start having insight into what you should be creating, in what form, how, and why" [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1088867957336231936)

"In order to make up for not having offline in-built networks that elite places (top schools, hot startups, branded employers) give you, the highest ROI thing one can do in their early 20s to catch lucky breaks is building an online network. It is a lot more “work” but worth it." [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1095729056245403648)

"All enterprise software competes with Excel.

All productivity software competes with emailing things to yourself." [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1106534188159778817)

"Probably the single biggest change in belief I’ve had since joining is that ambition properly harnessed can be an enormously productive force in the world." [[link]](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/)

"I'm finally comfortable admitting I have no hobbies. We have the entire historical catalogue of literature, music and (increasingly) film at our fingertips for the insane price of ~$30 a month. Any book can be delivered in a day. How is there time for hobbies?" [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/KTmBoyle/status/1145789680358588416)

"Most people need consistency more than they need intensity." [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1140030869328936960)

“Don’t get it right, get it written” James Buchanan

“See enough and write it down” Joan Didion

You’ve heard of “f— you money”, but there are also “f— you skills.”

"Personally, I think the goal should be technological progress. What constitutes social progress can't really be known in advance (sorry, Marx). We don't know what kind of society we'll want til we experiment and see. The best we can do is give ourselves as many tools as possible." [[link]](https://mobile.twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1157686845750202374)

> "“Try your best to deal with life without medicating yourself.”
“You mean drugs?”
“I mean drugs, food, shopping, money, whatever. I ain’t judging anybody, either. I was hooked on heroin for years. But now I’ve learned that every feeling will pass if you give it time. And if you learn to deal with your feelings, they will pass by faster each time. So don’t rush to cover them up by medicating them. You’ve got to deal with them.” [[link]](https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-the-worlds-most-powerful-fb5)
